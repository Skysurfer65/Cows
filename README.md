# Cows
The quest was:
You need to buy animals to the farm. There're 3 animals to choose from:
- Cows, will cost you 10 SEK
- Pigs, will cost you 3 SEK
- Hens, will cost you 0.5 SEK
(Cheap prices btw, must be an old challenge?!)
You must atleast have one animal of each and the total number of animals have to be the same as the amount of money you have to spend.
The original quest was to find the number of each animals to get 100 animals for 100 SEK but I've designed it for any integer amount.

**Example**
Let say you have 4567 SEK to spend, the result should be a total of 4567 animals and atleast one of each?
Find the number of solutions and get the solutions presented, and wait for the result..... it will iterate more than **2 Billion** times
to find all solutions!!!

This is what computers do best, billion trivial calculations in seconds...
